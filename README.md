An expense tracker prototype app with 10 pages each giving the user access to different parts of the app.
The code for the app is in basically C# which is an object oriented language.
The XAML files are the designer files for each page with inline code and the XAML.cs files are the code-behind files where the business logic is written.
For the best view ignore the momentum! Andriod and iOS files. Go straight to the momentum! folder open the 'pages' subfolder and view the code for each page available in the expense tracker prototype app.
